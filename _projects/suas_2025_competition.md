SUAS 2025 was the first year that UMBC AIAA SUAS managed to compete in in-person.
The <a href="https://suas-competition.org/">SUAS Competition</a> is a highly
international competition with the objective of having an autonomous aircraft
under 55 pounds perform missions such as delivering payload, mapping, identifying
objects, all while having design and performance constraints. As a part of the
competition requirement, a team website, design report and proof of flight video
had to be produced. In the actual fly-off, the team placed 19th out of 81 registered
teams. A video of the competition can be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLeCVutoYaw/">here</a>.
