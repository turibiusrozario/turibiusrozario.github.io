The annual AIAA Design, Build, Fly competition is an international
competition consisting of over 70 teams that "design, fabricate, and
demonstrate the flight capabilities of an electric powered, remote-
controlled airplane that can best meet the specified mission
profile.

The competition has 3 major milestones: proposal, design report, and
competition. The initial 6-page proposal is information dense regarding the
aircraft that the team will be building, and is required to be high quality
in order to get into competition.

## 2025 Proposal

In the 2025 competition year, the team utilized LaTeX to construct the proposal and
prototyped some of the design plans prior to the deadline for the proposal.
I was the project lead responsible for overseeing subteam tasks and overall
project directions in addition to training an intern. The proposal is shown
below.

            style="width:100%; max-width:960px; height:1080px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

Unfortunately, due to the line spacing in the proposal, the team did not qualify
in 2025.

## 2024 Proposal

This competition year, I was the project lead in charge of the team. I
oversaw proper task delegation, reviewed the final proposal, and personally
worked on the management summary and conceptual design.

The submitted proposal was accepted and ranked 21st out of 149 submissions.
The proposal can be read below:
