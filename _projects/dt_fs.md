Dovetail Firestyle (DT-FS) is an all-rounder quadcopter that is intended to be
(mostly) budget friendly and feature rich. Maximum speed achieved (and that I was
willing to go to) on the DT-FS was 85 mph. The hovering flight time is 7 minutes with
an action camera mounted. Since this quadcopter has 'some' long-range capabilities
(due to the use of ExpressLRS radio and 800 mW VTX), a GPS is present for
return-to-home in case of emergencies. The beeper activates in the event of a crash even when there is no power to the quadcopter.

The parts needed for construction
are available <a href="https://github.com/turibiusrozario/turibiusrozario.github.io/blob/main/assets/csv/UAVs-DT-Firestyle_BOM.csv">here</a>;
in case the links expire at the time of viewing, you can 
search the item using their name or find a similar alternative. The build should
cost no more than &dollar;400. I 3D printed TPU mounts: an 
<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6526185">action camera mount</a> and
<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6526197">a GPS mount</a>.
Use zip ties to secure everything to place, and heat shrink with zip tie to protect and align
the receiver antennas.
