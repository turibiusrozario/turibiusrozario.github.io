Switching between typing and navigating is time-consuming, since typing
requires both hands to be on the keyboard, while navigating requires the
right hand to be either on the arrow keys or the mouse. This is especially
worse for laptop users.
To reduce the need of switching, I produced a series of scripts that allows
the keyboard to be used as a mouse and a number pad. My work is hosted on
