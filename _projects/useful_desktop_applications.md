Note that this list is rather old. As of June 4th, 2025, I permanently switched
over to Linux (Mint and Kubuntu).

## Cross-Platform Applications

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> (Desktop, Web, Phones):
    Quizlet on steroids. Ask your friends in medical school if you need any convincing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> (Desktop):
    Free and open-source 3D-Modelling tool with a massive community support.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/briss/">Briss</a> (Desktop):
    Allows cropping contents out of .pdf files. Very useful if you need to
    extract high quality items from these files (e.g. figures from research
        papers).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="draw.io">draw.io</a> (Desktop, Web):
    A very easy-to-use and free diagram making software.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> (Desktop, Web, Phones):
    Basically Discord, but free, open-source, and ridiculously private. This is
    federated and encrypted, so only you and your recipient have access to
    messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"><b>Firefox</b></a>
    (Desktop, Phones): The only major non-Chrome based browser. This is
    especially important since Firefox supports ad-blocking better and there are
    numerous add-ons to significantly upgrade performance (such as returning
    YouTube dislike counts, removing YouTube ads, stronger privacy protection,
    etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> (Desktop): Free and open source
    vector drawing application. Extremely useful for drawing diagrams, editing
    PDF files, and vector art.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://joplinapp.org/help/install">Joplin</a> (Desktop, Phone):
    Minimal yet versatile note taking software with encryption and usability
    with ANY cloud storage (Google, OneDrive, Nextcloud, personal, etc.). This
    is similar to Obsidian, but is free and open sourced.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://kdenlive.org/">Kdenlive</a> (Desktop): Easy to use and
    minimal video-editing software.
  </li>
</ul>
