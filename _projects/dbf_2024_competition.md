After over 4 years, UMBC's student branch of AIAA took part in this
competition in-person. The team placed 21st out of over 140 teams in the
initial round, then to 105th in the second stage, and finally getting back
up to 66th place in the final stage. Despite having 5 aircraft crashes, the
team fought on. This was the first time in UMBC AIAA's history that the team
successfully completed the flight mission which involved taking off in less
than 20 feet, having a configurable wing, and above all, resisting wind and
gusts of 30 mph.

I was responsible for primary design and construction of the aircraft, which
involved CFD calculations, power calculations, wet layup for composite
materials (fiberglass and carbon fiber), and electronics. The most
excruciating moments were the flights. I was responsible for 3 of the 5
crashes. Despite the crashes, I am grateful for my teammates who came up
with last-minute repairs, because of which we were able to obtain a
proof-of-flight video just 18 hours before going to the competition.
