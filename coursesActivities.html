<h1>Courses and Activities</h1>

I am actively involved in co-curricular activities on campus. The projects
listed below are highlights from these activities, as well as some project-based
courses.

<h2>DBF 2024 Competition</h2>

<p>
    After over 4 years, UMBC's student branch of AIAA took part in this
    competition in-person. The team placed 21st out of over 140 teams in the
    initial round, then to 105th in the second stage, and finally getting back
    up to 66th place in the final stage. Despite having 5 aircraft crashes, the
    team fought on. This was the first time in UMBC AIAA's history that the team
    successfully completed the flight mission which involved taking off in less
    than 20 feet, having a configurable wing, and above all, resisting wind and
    gusts of 30 mph.
</p>
<p>
    I was responsible for primary design and construction of the aircraft, which
    involved CFD calculations, power calculations, wet layup for composite
    materials (fiberglass and carbon fiber), and electronics. The most
    excruciating moments were the flights. I was responsible for 3 of the 5
    crashes. Despite the crashes, I am grateful for my teammates who came up
    with last-minute repairs, because of which we were able to obtain a
    proof-of-flight video just 18 hours before going to the competition.

<h2>DBF Proposal FY2024</h2>

<p>
    The annual AIAA Design, Build, Fly competition is an international
    competition consisting of over 70 teams that "design, fabricate, and
    demonstrate the flight capabilities of an electric powered, remote-
    controlled airplane that can best meet the specified mission
    profile."<sup><a href="#dbf2024rules">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    The competition has 3 major milestones: proposal, design report, and
    competition. The initial 5-page proposal is information dense regarding the
    aircraft that the team will be building, and is required to be high quality
    in order to get into competition.
</p>
<p>
    This competition year, I was the project lead in charge of the team. I
    oversaw proper task delegation, reviewed the final proposal, and personally
    worked on the management summary and conceptual design.
</p>
<p>
    The submitted proposal was accepted and ranked 21st out of 149 submissions.
    The proposal can be read below:

    Background: This team project was a work from ENME204, Introduction to
    Engineering Design with CAD. The course of the objective was to design a toy
    under &dollar;200 for children with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Executive Summary</b> (copy-pasted):

    The Cube 3000 is a 3.5 inch fidget cube with electronic and non-electronic
    fidgets. The cube was designed to benefit children with autism and ADHD.
    Children with autism enjoy repetitive behaviors which are offered with the
    many fidgets on the cube. The cube offers an outlet for all the pent-up
    energy that children with ADHD have. Each cube face has a variety of
    fidgets. Side 4 has three buttons. The bottom white button is the one/off
    switch for the entire system. The red and blue buttons turn on separate
    motors to vibrate the cube. Side 6 has multiple switches to flick back and
    forth in addition to ball bearings to roll around. Side 1 contains the
    controlling knobs for the lights. Each knob adjusts the brightness of the
    red, blue, or yellow light which can be seen through the translucent top
    face. Side 3 contains three gears for fidgeting while also including a
    slider. Lastly, the bottom is the battery access panel which is a textured
    surface that the user can run their hand over and must be unscrewed to reach
    the battery for safety purposes. All of this was constructed with
    lightweight materials surrounded by silicon corner protectors to reduce
    sharp edges in addition to providing cushioning in the case of a fall. Gaps
    were minimized to prevent children from reaching the electronic components.
    The material used for the shell was pine wood. The motors, dials, ball
    bearings, battery casing, and buttons were premade. The rest of the cube was
    made out of 3-D printed materials. Although &dollar;183.80 out of the
    &dollar;200 budget was spent, the effective cost to construct the fidget
    cube was &dollar;44.13.
