Things that will be covered are:</p> <ol> <li>Pre-existing beginner guides</li> <li>Tools purchase list</li> <li>Parts purchase list</li> <li>Trainer design</li> <li>Flying guide</li> <li>Flight footage</li> </ol> <p>Websites where I generally make purchases from are:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://hobbyking.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HobbyKing</a>: Great place for wheels, propellers, and motors. Has many other airplane materials, but they are often expensive or out of stock.</li> <li> <a href="https://www.getfpv.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">getfpv</a>: Great for quadcopter and FPV parts. They also have great small propellers and batteries.</li> <li> <a href="https://www.banggood.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Banggood</a>: RC on a budget. I use this commonly if I am in no rush (shipping and delivery times are very long), there are no cheaper option, and if the item is not too expensive. Always read the reviews before making purchases here.</li> <li> <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AliExpress</a>: For items not found at a low cost from any of the above websites. This is the best place to purchase open source and/or generic lightweight items (such as ELRS receivers, Arduinos, etc.). Like Banggood, this is based in China; expect long shipping times and only purchase from stores that have a rating of 97% and have been open for more than 2 years.</li> <li> <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ebay</a>: Similar to AliExpress, but far better delivery times and reliability.</li> <li> <a href="https://store.flitetest.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FliteTest Store</a>: Really great place for kits and many DIY models. They have build videos for many of their products, so it is very hard to go wrong.</li> <li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>: I don't think I have to explain this one.</li> <li>Dollar Tree (in person): Purchase foam boards, dowels, paint, etc. from here. For foam board, ONLY purchase them from Dollar Tree! Other brands (Elmer's, Ross board, etc.) are significantly heavier!</li> </ul> <h2 id="pre-existing-beginner-guides">Pre-existing beginner guides</h2> <p>If you get tired of my guide, there exists other tutorials on getting into this hobby. The best and most useful, in my opinion, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6IuSFWz4ktvupu_gxw1vn-sjBGOkJFHV" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> <b>FliteTest’s Beginner Series</b> </a>. I personally used their beginner series and found it to be very informative yet easy to watch. Here’s a link to one of their build videos: <a href="https://youtu.be/KJWg5HJBGGc" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Flite Test Tiny Trainer </a>. There is also the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bllvhjr51Lk&amp;pp=ygUWam95cGxhbmVzIHRyYWluZXIgbWluaQ%3D%3D" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Joytrainer Mini </a> that you can try.</p> <h2 id="tools-purchase-list">Tools purchase list</h2> <p>The largest cost in getting into the hobby is the initial cost due to tools. However, keep in mind that you only need to buy these tools <i>once</i>. Additionally, these tools are helpful for other projects such as robotics, electronic repairs, and power supply. Here’s a list of non-electric tools to purchase:</p> <ol> <li>Needle nose pliers (make sure that they can have the wire cutter section)</li> <li>Size 11 craft knife (also known as x-acto knife)(make sure to get lots of blades)</li> <li> <b>Full</b> sized glue gun and glue sticks (higher wattage rating is generally better)</li> <li>Pencils and 2 measuring rulers (one should be dual units (metric and imperial), and the other should be a yard or a meter long)</li> <li>Screwdrivers (Phillips head and hex head mainly)</li> </ol> <p>I recommend purchasing a low-cost multimeter. These are mainly used to measure continuity and voltage for electronic parts.</p> <h3 id="battery-charger">Battery charger</h3> <p>You will need a dedicated battery charger for the <i>lithium</i> batteries. I personally use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Battery-Balance-Discharger-Adapter/dp/B07R18YNZQ" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> HTRC C150</a> because it is cheaper than other options, and comes with adapters and a battery bag. If you want to purchase any other charger, ensure that they are able to ‘storage discharge’ batteries and have multiple failsafe options. If you know you will be more involved in this hobby, or are planning on flying quadcopters, I have used and recommend the HTRC D240.</p> <h3 id="radio-transmitter">Radio transmitter</h3> <p>A radio transmitter (TX) is needed to control the aircraft. Keep in mind that a receiver (RX) is needed alongside. Here are a few options:</p> <ul> <li> FlySky FS-i6X if you are on a very tight budget and do <i>not</i> intend on flying drones or any other advanced aerial vehicles. I recommend the FS-iA6B receiver for this. </li> <li> FrSky QX7 (<b>ACCST</b>) if you can find this second hand or on a discount. Although I personally use this, I do not recommend it as this is rather outdated. </li> <li> <b>Radiomaster Pocket</b> (ELRS version). I recommend this transmitter if you are on a tight budget, intend to travel with your drones, or have small hands. However, if you plan on doing advanced aerial vehicles, I would rather go for the Boxer or TX16S. </li> <li> <b>Radiomaster Boxer</b> (ELRS version). I highly recommend this transmitter due to its middle ground between high functionality and simplicity. Joshua Bardwell did a <a href="https://youtu.be/5Fi9csa-wP8" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">review</a> that showcases this transmitter. </li> <li> Radiomaster TX16s Mark II (ELRS version) if you are sure you plan on doing high level remote-control in the future. </li> </ul> <p>Each of the above transmitters have their pros and cons. However, as mentioned earlier, these are <i>tools</i> and they will stick around for a long time. I recommend purchasing the Radiomaster Boxer transmitter because it has all the functions you need, is the third cheapest out of the list (factoring in cost of upgrades and receivers), and most importantly, the Radiomaster series is likely to stick around for a very long time. Additionally, I recommend getting the ‘ELRS’ option since it is open sourced and rapidly growing in popularity and features. If the Boxer is too pricey, the Radiomaster Pocket is an alternative.</p> <p>For ELRS, make sure to get the ‘FCC’ version. Any ELRS receiver can work with any ELRS TX. However, for airplanes, you will typically want to get a PWM ELRS RX with at least 4 <i>usable</i> PWM pins. Example brands for the PWM ELRS RX include: Radiomaster ER series, Mateksys, and Betafpv.</p> <h3 id="solder-station">Solder station</h3> <p>As you progress, you will need a solder station since many RC parts come unsoldered. When purchasing a solder station, make sure that it</p> <ul> <li>has temperature control, and</li> <li>comes with different tips (especially a bevel or chisel tip).</li> </ul> <p>Other things that I recommend having are:</p> <ul> <li>Sponge or brass wool</li> <li>Leaded solder</li> <li>Helping hands</li> <li>Solder sucker or solder wick (in case you need to remove solder)</li> </ul> <p>I personally use the X-Tronic 3020 solder station. If you have the budget, I recommend getting a soldering + hot air station, since it will help you in the long run.</p> <h2 id="parts-purchase-list">Parts purchase list</h2> <p>Some general parts to purchase are:</p> <ul> <li>Hoop and loop tape (also known as velcro)</li> <li>Rubber bands (assorted recommended)</li> <li>Heat shrink (I recommend 3:1 shrink ratio)</li> <li>Zip ties</li> <li>Glue sticks for the glue gun</li> <li>Battery tester</li> <li>Propellers</li> </ul> <p>If you are intending to build quadcopters, I recommend getting Loctite Blue to further secure nuts and bolts.</p> <h2 id="building-plans-trainer-airplane">Building plans: Trainer Airplane</h2> <p>My recommendation to get started with RC airplanes is to purchase the items listed in this <a href="https://github.com/turibiusrozario/turibiusrozario.github.io/blob/main/assets/csv/UAVs-Trainer-BOM.csv" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> spreadsheet </a>. I already added links to the purchases, however, you can easily find alternatives. Only the motor mount has to be 3D printed, preferably with PETG (other materials work, however they come with their own disadvantages). The 3D printable file for this can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zS25tqwQ07R53doif9VbXIQ5sc2w6WNp/view?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p>The plans for the work is below:</p> <div class="post" style="width:100%; margin:0 auto;"> <object data="../../assets/pdf/projects-getting_started-design.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%; max-width:960px; height:1080px; display:block; margin:0 auto;"> </object> </div> <p>This trainer flying wing can be built in less than 4 hours for a beginner, and 1.5 hours for someone with experience.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Turibius Rozario.
