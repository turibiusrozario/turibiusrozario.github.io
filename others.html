			<h2>Keyboard Navigation Enhancement</h2>
			<p>
				Switching between typing and navigating is time-consuming,
				since typing requires both hands to be on the keyboard,
				while navigating requires the right hand to be either on the arrow keys
				or the mouse. This is especially worse for laptop users.
			</p>
			<p>
				To reduce the need of switching,
				I produced a series of scripts that allows the keyboard to be used as
				a mouse and a number pad. My work is hosted on GitHub here:

					PETG, TPU, and PLA+.

			<p>
				Since I print with PETG and sometimes with TPU,
				and since my room has a humidifier,
				I decided to create a DIY passive filament dry box,
				so that the filaments can be quickly changed.
			</p>
			<p>
				This dry box was made using an 18L waterproof box
				with a PVC pipe as the spool holder. Nuts and bolts
				held the 3D printed pipe holder in place,
				and PTFE tube with coupler
				was used to reduce moisture going into the box.
				Silica gel packets were placed inside as a passive dryer.

            <h2>Take Back Your Control: Android</h2>
            <p>
                If you use Android, it likely comes with bloatware ---
                pre-installed apps that you do not use nor need. Worse, there
                are applications running in the background that constantly
                degrade battery life --- in particular, almost all of Google
                services. Worst, the Android that you paid for will not be
                supported nor last as much as you may want it to.
            </p>
            <p>
                In search for making my cellphone battery last longer hours,
                and the phone itself to last more years, I began the journey of
                'De-Googling' my phone. This does not mean removing all Google
                components. To me, it means utilizing as little closed-source
                and power-hungry applications as possible, which apps made by
                big tech tend to be. My process was as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li> Switching to an open-source OS that does not contain
                        bloatware and major Google backends by default.
                    <li> Utilizing open-source or minimal applications.
                    <li> Regaining ability to use Google applications.
                </ol>
                <a href="https://divestos.org/misc/e.txt">Here</a> is a
                comparison of some of the major open-source OS that does not
                have tracking, and is Google free. If you use a Pixel device,
                it is best to use <a
                    href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>.
                Otherwise, <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices">\/e\/</a>
                is an option that is ready to use upon installations.
                I personally use <a href="https://lineage.microg.org/">LineageOS
                    for MicroG</a> since it allows me to utilize some required
                Google Apps.
            </p>
			<p>
				The very first installation is expected to be the hardest.
				The process should be the same regardless of what Android you use:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Backup all files: the easiest method is to directly connect
						your phone to your computer, and copy all files that you have.
						I additionally recommend going to each app and exporting any 
						configurations that you may have (e.g. contacts, text messages,
						authenticator codes, etc.). I also recommend having a list of
						a list of apps you realistically use so that you can re-download 
						them later.
					</li>
					<li>
						Unlocking the bootloader: There are several existing online 
						tutorials for unlocking the bootloader. <a href="https://youtu.be/ksbRMo00uTA">
							Here
						</a> is an example; despite being over 6 years old, the methodology
						is applicable today. You can use the <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools">
							developer's page
						</a> to download platform tools which will be needed as you follow
						along any bootloader unlock video.
					</li>
					<li>
						Once unlocked, you can follow <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">your 
							specific device's instructions on how to install LineageOS
						</a>. However, if you want LineageOS <em>for MicroG</em>, which allows 
						better 'De-Googling' while still being able to use Google applications,
						you should use the image file (.iso file) from <a href="https://download.lineage.microg.org/">
							MicroG's website
						</a> instead of Lineage's .iso file.
						You will not have to install any additional files using this method.
					</li>
					<li>
						After completing the reboot, check out F-Droid and all the interesting
						things LineageOS for MicroG comes with! You will find many better and ad-free
						alternatives to certain applications you used to use. Or you can use your backup 
						to regain all your past files and re-download your past apps through
						Aurora Store (which can be downloaded through F-Droid).
					</li>
				</ol>
				It is possible to go even further and root your phone with 
				<a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html">Magisk</a>
				which allows even greater customization such as significantly 
				<a href="https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/">improved
					camera quality</a>, 
				<a href="https://github.com/di72nn/callrecorder-axet">access to call recording</a>, and 
				<a href="https://github.com/MatteCarra/AccA">controlling how much your 
					phone charges</a>
				 (e.g., to increase longevity of your battery).
