<h2>Headtracker with FPV Camera (Prototype)</h2>

<p>
    First-person view (FPV) planes are not as interesting as FPV quadcopters due
    to model planes' limited mobility. However, a headtracker &mdash; a device
    that tracks the motion of the head &mdash; can be utilized to give a more
    'real' feel. Below is my prototype headtracker; I utilized <a
    href="https://headtracker.gitbook.io/head-tracker">this</a> head tracker
    software on an Arduino Nano BLE with an on-board IMU. 
</p>

    Prototype Headtracker Demonstration
</div>

<p>
    This can be taken further and programmed with INAV or ArduPilot to act as
    a gimbal. Below was a test gimbal that would keep the orientation of the 
    camera steady during roll and pitch of the drone. This was paired with the
    headtracker to be able to look up and down while also having the visuals
    stabilized. I would not recommend this setup, especially with low-quality
    servos, since the vibrations propagate into the video and there is a high 
    chance of loosing the sense of orientation.

<h2>Keyboard Navigation Enhancement</h2>

<p>
    Switching between typing and navigating is time-consuming, since typing
    requires both hands to be on the keyboard, while navigating requires the
    right hand to be either on the arrow keys or the mouse. This is especially
    worse for laptop users.
</p>
<p>
    To reduce the need of switching, I produced a series of scripts that allows
    the keyboard to be used as a mouse and a number pad. My work is hosted on
    GitHub here:

<h2>Active Filament Dryer</h2>

<div class="fig">
    <img src="Images/others-dehydrator.jpg"
    alt="Image of active dehydrator">
    DIY active filmanet dehydrator
</div>

<p>
    Since some of my filaments were sitting out for a long time, I decided to
    make an active dehydrator. I had some low-cost cork panels lying around.
    Cork, despite being made from wood, is pretty fire resistant. It also is 
    somewhat insulating. I used cork as the body, held together with some 
    CA (superglue). Two barbecue skewers were placed through the body to prevent
    the spool from touching the bottom. At the bottom, a 34 inch 22 gauge nichrome
    wire with a resistance of 1.016 Ohm/ft was used as the heating element. I
    had to keep it in a wavy shape without having the wires touch each other.
    For extra safety, I covered the nichrome with some fiberglass cloth to prevent
    shorts, and high concentrations of heat. The ends of the wire stuck out of the
    dehydrator.
</p>

<p>
    Outside, alligator clips would supply voltage from a battery charger to heat
    the wires. An Arduino nano with a DHT11 sensor was used to monitor the
    temperature and humidity. A 12V 60mm DC fan kept airflow active. The sensors
    and modules were powered from the same supply as the nichrome wire. This is
    possible since the Arduino nano accepts 7 to 12V, and the nichrome wire can
    utilize the same voltage range to output around 20 to 50W. In my uses,
    11V was a good starting voltage to heat up the dehumidifier. Once a
    temperature of 50°C is obtained, I would bring the voltage down to around 9.5V.
    This would maintain a steady temperature of around 54°C at an ambient
    temperature of 23°C. The humidity would reach 0% within 3 hours.
</p>

<p>
    If you decide to make this, note that different voltages maybe needed. I was
    also drying LW PLA which accepts 50°C to 55°C. For filaments such as ABS or PETG,
    you would have to use higher temperatures. Overall, this worked better than
    dehydrators that can be bought online, and was also low cost (less than $30,
    excluding the power supply).
</p>

<h2>Filament Dry Box</h2>

    <div class="fig">
        <img
        src="Images/others-dry_box.jpg"
        alt="Image of my filament dry box">
        DIY filament dry box containing lightweight LW PLA, PETG, TPU, and PLA+.
    </div>
<p>
    Since I print with PETG and sometimes with TPU, and since my room has a
    humidifier, I decided to create a DIY passive filament dry box, so that the
    filaments can be quickly changed.
</p>
<p>
    This dry box was made using an 18L waterproof box with a PVC pipe as the
    spool holder. Nuts and bolts held the 3D printed pipe holder in place, and
    PTFE tube with coupler was used to reduce moisture going into the box.
    Silica gel packets were placed inside as a passive dryer.
</p>
<p>
    Overtime, I realized that the PVC pipe did not offer the smoothest rolling,
    and made replacing spools difficult. I have since then swapped to 608 roller
    bearings held down by 3D printed holders.

<h2>Take Back Your Control: Android</h2>

<p>
    If you use Android, it likely comes with bloatware --- pre-installed apps
    that you do not use nor need. Worse, there are applications running in the
    background that constantly degrade battery life --- in particular, almost
    all of Google services. Worst, the Android that you paid for will not be
    supported nor last as much as you may want it to.
</p>
<p>
    In search for making my cellphone battery last longer hours, and the phone
    itself to last more years, I began the journey of 'De-Googling' my phone.
    This does not mean removing all Google components. To me, it means utilizing
    as little closed-source and power-hungry applications as possible, which
    apps made by big tech tend to be. My process was as follows:
    <ol>
    <li> Switching to an open-source OS that does not contain bloatware and
        major Google backends by default.
    <li> Utilizing open-source or minimal applications.
    <li> Regaining ability to use Google applications.
    </ol>
    <a href="https://divestos.org/misc/e.txt">Here</a> is a comparison of some
    of the major open-source OS that does not have tracking, and is Google free.
    If you use a Pixel device, it is best to use <a
    href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>. Otherwise, <a
    href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices">\/e\/</a> is an option that is ready
to use upon installations. I personally use <a
    href="https://lineage.microg.org/">LineageOS for MicroG</a> since it allows
me to utilize some required Google Apps.
</p>
<p>
    The very first installation is expected to be the hardest. The process
    should be the same regardless of what Android you use:
    <ol>
    <li>
        Backup all files: the easiest method is to directly connect your phone
        to your computer, and copy all files that you have. I additionally
        recommend going to each app and exporting any configurations that you
        may have (e.g. contacts, text messages, authenticator codes, etc.). I
        also recommend having a list of a list of apps you realistically use so
        that you can re-download them later.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unlocking the bootloader: There are several existing online tutorials
        for unlocking the bootloader. <a href="https://youtu.be/ksbRMo00uTA">
            Here </a> is an example; despite being over 6 years old, the
        methodology is applicable today. You can use the <a
            href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools">
            developer's page </a> to download platform tools which will be
        needed as you follow along any bootloader unlock video.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once unlocked, you can follow <a
            href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">your specific device's
            instructions on how to install LineageOS </a>. However, if you want
        LineageOS <em>for MicroG</em>, which allows better 'De-Googling' while
        still being able to use Google applications, you should use the image
        file (.iso file) from <a href="https://download.lineage.microg.org/">
        MicroG's website </a> instead of Lineage's .iso file. You will not have
    to install any additional files using this method.
    </li>
    <li>
        After completing the reboot, check out F-Droid and all the interesting
        things LineageOS for MicroG comes with! You will find many better and
        ad-free alternatives to certain applications you used to use. Or you can
        use your backup to regain all your past files and re-download your past
        apps through Aurora Store (which can be downloaded through F-Droid).
    </li>
    </ol>
    It is possible to go even further and root your phone with <a
        href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html">Magisk</a> which
    allows even greater customization such as significantly <a
        href="https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/">improved
        camera quality</a>, <a
        href="https://github.com/di72nn/callrecorder-axet">access to call
        recording</a>, and <a
        href="https://github.com/MatteCarra/AccA">controlling how much your
        phone charges</a> (e.g., to increase longevity of your battery).
