			<h2>Keyboard Navigation Enhancement</h2>
			<p>
				Switching between typing and navigating is time-consuming,
				since typing requires both hands to be on the keyboard,
				while navigating requires the right hand to be either on the arrow keys
				or the mouse. This is especially worse for laptop users.
			</p>
			<p>
				To reduce the need of switching,
				I produced a series of scripts that allows the keyboard to be used as
				a mouse and a number pad. My work is hosted on GitHub here:

			<p>
				Since I print with PETG and sometimes with TPU,
				and since my room has a humidifier,
				I decided to create a DIY passive filament dry box,
				so that the filaments can be quickly changed.
			</p>
			<p>
				This dry box was made using an 18L waterproof box
				with a PVC pipe as the spool holder. Nuts and bolts
				held the 3D printed pipe holder in place,
				and PTFE tube with coupler
				was used to reduce moisture going into the box.
				Silica gel packets were placed inside as a passive dryer.
