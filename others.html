<h2>Nextcloud: Microsoft 365 and Google Suite Replacement</h2>

<p>
    Nextcloud is a completely free and open-source solution to substituting
    Microsoft 365 and Google Suite. Imagine Google Drive, Calendar, Notes,
    Photos, Meet, and more, but completely self-hosted, secure, and truly yours.
    With Nextcloud, <it>you own your data</it>.
</p>

<p>
    I host my own Nextcloud server at <a href="https://alexandria.turibiusrozario.com/">
        alexandria.turibiusrozario.com
    </a> that I regularly use for all personal files 
    and activities. This is done using a Raspberry Pi 4, an external hard drive,
    and a domain. Below is a guide on setting Nextcloud up. This guide is 
    tested and true as of 2025-08-29.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Getting all the parts</h3>

<p>
    <b>Purchase a small computer</b>. This can be a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, with 8 GB RAM.
    Lower-cost alternatives are available such as Orange Pi, as well as more 
    powerfull options such as mini computers. In general, if you plan on having 
    lots of computations such as AI and video recording, aim for a mini computer.
    You can also use an old computer as a server, so long as it can run Linux 
    (non-Linux works, but that is beyond the scope of this guide). If you are intending
    to use a Raspberry Pi or similar, also purchase a fan for cooling.
</p>

<p>
    My setup utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8 GB RAM, with a cooling fan 
    attached. I use a fast phone charger to power the Pi.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Warning</b>: If you use a Pi or similar, always power it with an appropriate
    power supply. For the Pi 4, a 5V 3A (or higher than 3A) power supply is required.
</p>

<p>
    <b>If you are NOT using a Raspberry Pi or similar, you have to tweak certain 
        aspects of this guide!
    </b>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Purchase some memory</b>. This can be a simple microSD card that is 128 GB 
    and above. If you plan on hosting a lot of files, particularly videos,
    purchase a 16 or 32 GB microSD card along with an external hard drive of your
    choice.
</p>
<p>
    My setup utilizes a 32 GB microSD card (a 16 would have been fine) with a 1 TB 
    external hard disk.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Purchase a domain</b>. Go to <a href="https://porkbun.com/">porkbun</a>,
    make an account, find a domain, and purchase it. Ensure that the renewal 
    price is not too high, and avoid top-level domains (tld) that do not offer WHOIS 
    privacy. Top-level domains are the ".com", ".net", ".us", etc. that you would 
    see websites end with. WHOIS allows anyone to identify a domain owner, and WHOIS 
    privacy prevents that. This is important since you have to use your phone number 
    and or address to purchase a domain; with WHOIS privacy, you keep this information
    safe. Avoid a tld such as ".us", which does not allow WHOIS privacy.
</p>
<p>
    For my setup, I purchased "turibiusrozario.com" for $11. I could have purchased 
    "turibiusrozario.us" for $6, but that would publicize my phone number and personal
    address, hence I did not purchase the ".us".
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the microSD card for the Pi</h3>

<p>
    Download and install the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">
        Raspberry Pi Imager
    </a>. Plug your microSD card in, and run the Imager.
    Select the Pi device you are using, select "OS Lite 64-bit" as the 
    operating system (this option might be hidden away in a submenu), and select 
    the <b>correct</b> microSD card.
</p>

<p>
    Click "Next". Edit some configurations, primarily the names and connectivity.
    Set a name for the Pi ("local name"), a name for the user ("hostname"), and a 
    password. Enter the Wifi credentials, i.e., the wifi name and password. Ensure 
    that SSH is enabled. Go ahead and continue with installing the operating system
    on to the microSD card.
</p>

<p>
    Once done, plug the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and connect it to a 
    correct power supply.
</p>

<p>
    If you are using a mini computer or an old computer, install a Linux operating 
    system on it. If you want to stick to this guide as closely as possible, 
    install Debian.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Pi for Nextcloud</h3>

<p>
    If you are using an external hard drive as the storage media, please format 
    it as ext4 file format. Connect it to the Pi.
</p>

<p>
    While the Pi is powered on, SSH into the Pi. To do this, you can open your terminal 
    on a computer and simply type "ssh your_hostname@locale_name.local" to 
    enter. If you are using an old or mini computer, you can follow all the bottom 
    commands without having to SSH.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Warning</b>: In general, you should not just 'unplug' the Pi to power it off.
    It is always recommended that you run <code>sudo shutdown</code> while connected 
    via SSH to shut the Pi down.
</p>

<p>
    If you are using a Pi, you will have to fix locale issues (assuming you are 
    in the US). Once you have SSH'ed into the Pi, enter 
    <code>sudo localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8</code>
</p>

<p>
    If you are using an external hard drive as your storage, do the following:
    <ol>
        <li><code>
            sudo blkid
        </code>: This showcases all the storages. Your drive will be listed 
        as something like <code>/dev/sdaX</code>. Remember the PARTUUID.</li>
        <li><code>
            sudo mkdir /media/NAME
        </code>: Replace "NAME" with any name you would want to use for 
        the drive. I named mine "Alexandria", though most people simply do "Nextcloud".
        </li>
        <li></li>
        <li><code>
            sudo nano /etc/fstab
        </code>: Once in the text editor, add a new line with the following entry:
        <code>
            PARTUUID=abcdefgh-00 /media/NAME ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=10s 0 2
        </code>. Of course, replace the PARTUID and NAME with the correct ones.
        Save and exit by pressing CTRL + X, then pressing ENTER.</li>
        <li><code>
            sudo usermod -aG hostname hostname
        </code>: Replace "hostname" with the correct hostname.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>
                sudo chown -R hostname /media/NAME 
            </code>: Replace "hostname" and "NAME" with the correct ones.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>
                sudo restart
            </code>: This will close SSH and restart the Pi. You are done with 
            configurating the external hard drive. Make sure to SSH back in.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    Update and restart the Pi by running <code>
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo restart
    </code>. Once it restarts, SSH back into the Pi.
    You can now practically copy and paste the following chunk of code:
</p>
<pre><code>
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

    # Add the repository to Apt sources:
    echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
    $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
    sudo docker run hello-world
    sudo groupadd docker # this might already be done automatically
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER # adds myself to use docker group
    newgrp docker # refresh users
    docker run hello-world # Test if you can use docker without sudo
    docker rm $(docker ps -qa) # deletes all the hello-world
    docker ps -a # should return nothing
</code></pre>

<p>
    The above code block is taken from the Docker installation guide.
    If you want to see what all the code does, the full guide to 
    installing docker can be found <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Installing Nextcloud</h3>

<p>
    All of the following in this section is done on the Pi. SSH into the Pi to run the commands.
    If you use a mini computer or an old computer, run the commands on the computer directly.
</p>

<p>
    I enabled IPv6 protocol on my Pi for future support (more details about this can be
    found <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/blob/main/docker-ipv6-support.md">here</a>).
    To do this, make a new file:
</p>
<pre><code>
    sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json # This file did not exist for me; made new
</code></pre>
<p>
    And add the lines
</p>
<pre><code>
{
    "default-network-opts": {"bridge":{"com.docker.network.enable_ipv6":"true"}}
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    And save and exit by pressing CTRL+X and Enter. Then, run:
</p>
<pre><code>
sudo systemctl restart docker
sudo docker network inspect nextcloud-aio | grep EnableIPv6
# The above command verifies if it's enabled. 
# It's likely not, and in fact, AIO should be missing on a first time setup. 
# So run:
sudo docker network create nextcloud-aio
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Identify the IP address of the Pi. This can be done by entering 
    <code>hostname -I</code>. The IP address is typically in the 
    format of "10.0.0.XX" (IPv4). 
    Remember this address since it will be needed later.
</p>

<p>
    The following code is taken directly from the Nextcloud AIO. You can see all their
    guides and documentation <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one">here</a>.
    I used the following code, where "NAME" refers to my harddrive; change it accordingly.
    You can remove the entire line if you are not using an external hard drive.
</p>
<pre><code>
sudo docker run \
--init \
--sig-proxy=false \
--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer \
--restart always \
--publish 80:80 \
--publish 8080:8080 \
--publish 8443:8443 \
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR="/media/NAME" \
ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest
</code></pre>

<h3>Step 5: Internet Configurations and Finishing Up</h3>

<p>
    Head to your router's configuration page, which can typically be accessed by going to 
    "10.0.0.1" on your browser. There, make the IP address for the Pi (found earlier) to be 
    a "Reserved IP" instead of DHCP. This prevents the local address from changing.
</p>

<p>
    To enable access to the Pi from anywhere in the world (with internet connectivity), ports
    have to be opened. On the router's configuration page, look for "Port Forwarding" option.
    Forward the following ports for the Pi:
    <ul>
        <li>80 TCP</li>
        <li>443 TCP and UDP</li>
        <li>3478 TCP and UDP</li>
        <li>8443 TCP</li>
    </ul>
    That is all the configurations needed on the router.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note</b>: There are several IP addresses. There are IPv4 addresses that are in the 
    format of X.X.X.X, and IPv6 addresses that are in the format of X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. Some 
    of these addresses can be local: these are visible only while connected to your router,
    and is the one that you just found in the above step. There are public IP addresses that 
    can be seen from anywhere in the world: this will be used in the next step.
</p>

<p>
    Next, the domain has to be configured to forward to your Nextcloud. On Porkbun, I had to
    click on "DNS" to configure. Make a Type "A - Address record" with an answer/value
    consisting of the public IP address. This can be found by searching "What's my IP?" online.
    The hostname can be left blank if you want "your_domain.tld" to point to Nextcloud.
    I used "alexandria.turibiusrozario.com" as the domain, and a TTL value of 3600. This record 
    uses the IPv4 public address. You can additionally add the IPv6 address by creating a Type 
    "AAAA" address record; this will have the same domain name and TTL, but the answer/value will 
    be the IPv6 address (again, you can find this by simply searching "what is my IPv6 address?").
</p>

<p>
    Now, go to "https://10.0.0.X:8080/setup"; replace X with the correct number that points to the Pi.
    From here, simply follow all the instructions on screen.
</p>

<p>
    Once you reach the page where you can choose your containers, keep in mind that the more
    containers you enable, the more processing power you will need on your device. I kept all 
    the defaults enabled only. Once you click 'Start', it might take as much as 10 minutes before
    everything is ready. Then, you can finally go to "https://your_domain.tld" and enjoy NextCloud!
</p>

<h2>Headtracker with FPV Camera (Prototype)</h2>

<p>
    First-person view (FPV) planes are not as interesting as FPV quadcopters due
    to model planes' limited mobility. However, a headtracker &mdash; a device
    that tracks the motion of the head &mdash; can be utilized to give a more
    'real' feel. Below is my prototype headtracker; I utilized <a
    href="https://headtracker.gitbook.io/head-tracker">this</a> head tracker
    software on an Arduino Nano BLE with an on-board IMU. 
</p>


<div class="fig">
    <iframe width="644" height="362"

    Prototype Headtracker Demonstration
</div>

<p>
    This can be taken further and programmed with INAV or ArduPilot to act as
    a gimbal. Below was a test gimbal that would keep the orientation of the 
    camera steady during roll and pitch of the drone. This was paired with the
    headtracker to be able to look up and down while also having the visuals
    stabilized. I would not recommend this setup, especially with low-quality
    servos, since the vibrations propagate into the video and there is a high 
    chance of loosing the sense of orientation.

<h2>Keyboard Navigation Enhancement</h2>

<p>
    Switching between typing and navigating is time-consuming, since typing
    requires both hands to be on the keyboard, while navigating requires the
    right hand to be either on the arrow keys or the mouse. This is especially
    worse for laptop users.
</p>
<p>
    To reduce the need of switching, I produced a series of scripts that allows
    the keyboard to be used as a mouse and a number pad. My work is hosted on
    GitHub here:

<h2>Active Filament Dryer</h2>

<div class="fig">
    <img src="Images/others-dehydrator.jpg"
    alt="Image of active dehydrator">
    DIY active filmanet dehydrator
</div>

<p>
    Since some of my filaments were sitting out for a long time, I decided to
    make an active dehydrator. I had some low-cost cork panels lying around.
    Cork, despite being made from wood, is pretty fire resistant. It also is 
    somewhat insulating. I used cork as the body, held together with some 
    CA (superglue). Two barbecue skewers were placed through the body to prevent
    the spool from touching the bottom. At the bottom, a 34 inch 22 gauge nichrome
    wire with a resistance of 1.016 Ohm/ft was used as the heating element. I
    had to keep it in a wavy shape without having the wires touch each other.
    For extra safety, I covered the nichrome with some fiberglass cloth to prevent
    shorts, and high concentrations of heat. The ends of the wire stuck out of the
    dehydrator.
</p>

<p>
    Outside, alligator clips would supply voltage from a battery charger to heat
    the wires. An Arduino nano with a DHT11 sensor was used to monitor the
    temperature and humidity. A 12V 60mm DC fan kept airflow active. The sensors
    and modules were powered from the same supply as the nichrome wire. This is
    possible since the Arduino nano accepts 7 to 12V, and the nichrome wire can
    utilize the same voltage range to output around 20 to 50W. In my uses,
    11V was a good starting voltage to heat up the dehumidifier. Once a
    temperature of 50°C is obtained, I would bring the voltage down to around 9.5V.
    This would maintain a steady temperature of around 54°C at an ambient
    temperature of 23°C. The humidity would reach 0% within 3 hours.
</p>

<p>
    If you decide to make this, note that different voltages maybe needed. I was
    also drying LW PLA which accepts 50°C to 55°C. For filaments such as ABS or PETG,
    you would have to use higher temperatures. Overall, this worked better than
    dehydrators that can be bought online, and was also low cost (less than $30,
    excluding the power supply).
</p>

<h2>Filament Dry Box</h2>

    <div class="fig">
        <img
        src="Images/others-dry_box.jpg"
        alt="Image of my filament dry box">
        DIY filament dry box containing lightweight LW PLA, PETG, TPU, and PLA+.
    </div>
<p>
    Since I print with PETG and sometimes with TPU, and since my room has a
    humidifier, I decided to create a DIY passive filament dry box, so that the
    filaments can be quickly changed.
</p>
<p>
    This dry box was made using an 18L waterproof box with a PVC pipe as the
    spool holder. Nuts and bolts held the 3D printed pipe holder in place, and
    PTFE tube with coupler was used to reduce moisture going into the box.
    Silica gel packets were placed inside as a passive dryer.
</p>
<p>
    Overtime, I realized that the PVC pipe did not offer the smoothest rolling,
    and made replacing spools difficult. I have since then swapped to 608 roller
    bearings held down by 3D printed holders. The whole dry box was then bolted
    onto my 3D printer so that the filament can directly feed into the extruders.
    Wood was used as supports for the plastic.
</p>

<h2>Take Back Your Control: Android</h2>

<p>
    If you use Android, it likely comes with bloatware --- pre-installed apps
    that you do not use nor need. Worse, there are applications running in the
    background that constantly degrade battery life --- in particular, almost
    all of Google services. Worst, the Android that you paid for will not be
    supported nor last as much as you may want it to.
</p>
<p>
    In search for making my cellphone battery last longer hours, and the phone
    itself to last more years, I began the journey of 'De-Googling' my phone.
    This does not mean removing all Google components. To me, it means utilizing
    as little closed-source and power-hungry applications as possible, which
    apps made by big tech tend to be. My process was as follows:
    <ol>
    <li> Switching to an open-source OS that does not contain bloatware and
        major Google backends by default.
    <li> Utilizing open-source or minimal applications.
    <li> Regaining ability to use Google applications.
    </ol>
    <a href="https://divestos.org/misc/e.txt">Here</a> is a comparison of some
    of the major open-source OS that does not have tracking, and is Google free.
    If you use a Pixel device, it is best to use <a
    href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>. Otherwise, <a
    href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices">\/e\/</a> is an option that is ready
to use upon installations. I personally use <a
    href="https://lineage.microg.org/">LineageOS for MicroG</a> since it allows
me to utilize some required Google Apps.
</p>
<p>
    The very first installation is expected to be the hardest. The process
    should be the same regardless of what Android you use:
    <ol>
    <li>
        Backup all files: the easiest method is to directly connect your phone
        to your computer, and copy all files that you have. I additionally
        recommend going to each app and exporting any configurations that you
        may have (e.g. contacts, text messages, authenticator codes, etc.). I
        also recommend having a list of a list of apps you realistically use so
        that you can re-download them later.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unlocking the bootloader: There are several existing online tutorials
        for unlocking the bootloader. <a href="https://youtu.be/ksbRMo00uTA">
            Here </a> is an example; despite being over 6 years old, the
        methodology is applicable today. You can use the <a
            href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools">
            developer's page </a> to download platform tools which will be
        needed as you follow along any bootloader unlock video.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once unlocked, you can follow <a
            href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">your specific device's
            instructions on how to install LineageOS </a>. However, if you want
        LineageOS <em>for MicroG</em>, which allows better 'De-Googling' while
        still being able to use Google applications, you should use the image
        file (.iso file) from <a href="https://download.lineage.microg.org/">
        MicroG's website </a> instead of Lineage's .iso file. You will not have
    to install any additional files using this method.
    </li>
    <li>
        After completing the reboot, check out F-Droid and all the interesting
        things LineageOS for MicroG comes with! You will find many better and
        ad-free alternatives to certain applications you used to use. Or you can
        use your backup to regain all your past files and re-download your past
        apps through Aurora Store (which can be downloaded through F-Droid).

<h2>Useful Desktop Applications</h2>

<p>
    Speaking of useful applications, here are some applications that I have
    grown fond of over the years.
</p>

<h3>Cross-Platform Applications</h3>

<ul>
<li>
    <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> (Desktop, Web, Phones):

</li>
<li>
    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"><b>Firefox</b></a>
    (Desktop, Phones): The only major non-Chrome based browser. This is
    especially important since Firefox supports ad-blocking better and there are
    numerous add-ons to significantly upgrade performance (such as returning
    YouTube dislike counts, removing YouTube ads, stronger privacy protection,
    etc.)
