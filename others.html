            <h2>Keyboard Navigation Enhancement</h2>
            <p>
                Switching between typing and navigating is time-consuming,
                since typing requires both hands to be on the keyboard,
                while navigating requires the right hand to be either on the arrow keys
                or the mouse. This is especially worse for laptop users.
            </p>
            <p>
                To reduce the need of switching,
                I produced a series of scripts that allows the keyboard to be used as
                a mouse and a number pad. My work is hosted on GitHub here:

            <h2>Filament Dry Box</h2>
            <p>
                (In progress.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I print with PETG and sometimes with TPU,
                and since my room has a humidifier,
                I decided to create a DIY passive filament dry box,
                so that the filaments can be quickly changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dry box was made using an 18L waterproof box
                with a PVC pipe as the spool holder. Nuts and bolts
                held things in place, and bowden tube with coupler
                was used to guide the filament out of the box
                (and additionally minimize humidity inside).
                Silica gel packets were placed inside as a passive dryer.
