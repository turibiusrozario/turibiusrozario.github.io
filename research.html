                The first is the pressure differential available for the oil pump;
                this curve starts at 4300 psi, and parabolically decreases.
                The second is a cross indicating the system requirement.
                This is located at the 3500 psi and 23 GPM location,
                which is underneath the curve of pressure differential available.
                The third is a vertical line indicating the maximum flow rate achievable (24 GPM).">

                to the achievable pressure differential (4300 psi supply) and flow rate.
