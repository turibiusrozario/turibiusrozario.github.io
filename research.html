            <p>
                I intend to pursue a PhD in Mechanical Engineering in the studies of 
                performance optimization, 
                process automation, 
                energy conservation, and 
                aeronautical systems. 
                Although I am yet to decide on a focus, 
                I am actively looking for summer research internships 
                (in academia and industry) in any of the above fields and 
                am currently in sustained lab during the academic year. 
                My current or previous research experiences are listed below.

                A self-powered and decentralized wave energy converter and desalination system
                was proposed in prior work by the MEPS lab. The wave energy is harvested using a large
                oscillating flap hinged at the sea bed, whose kinetic energy is then transferred into 
                hydraulics; the pressurized seawater is used to generate electricity and freshwater.

                My role over the summer was to help scale this full-scale system to a lab-scale 
                hardware-in-the-loop test system. With the help of my graduate mentor, Jeremy Simmons,
                I:
                <ol>
                    <li>Used fluid equations, efficiency computations, and dimension constraints to size 
                        the system.</li>
                    <li>Identified parts required to construct the system and generated a bill of materials.</li>
                    <li>Designed custom parts and fittings, and a draft assembly model.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Figure <a href="#cornerCondition">4</a> compares the maximum
                required pressure differential to the achievable pressure differential based on the energy losses
                through a specific servo valve; the maximum required flow rate is compared against
                the achievable flow of the pump. Performance evaluations such as this helped determine
                whether the combination of the chosen parts would be capable of simulating the motion
                of the wave energy converter.
