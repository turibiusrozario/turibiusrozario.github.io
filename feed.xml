Imagine Google Drive, Calendar, Notes, Photos, Meet, and more, but completely self-hosted, secure, and truly yours. With Nextcloud, <it>you own your data</it>.</p> <p>I host my own Nextcloud server at <a href="https://alexandria.turibiusrozario.com/"> alexandria.turibiusrozario.com </a> that I regularly use for all personal files and activities. This is done using a Raspberry Pi 4, an external hard drive, and a domain. Below is a guide on setting Nextcloud up. This guide is tested and true as of 2025-08-29.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/others-Nextcloud-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/others-Nextcloud-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/others-Nextcloud-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/others-Nextcloud.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="My Nextcloud Dashboard" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> My Nextcloud dashboard </div> <h2 id="step-1-getting-all-the-parts">Step 1: Getting all the parts</h2> <p><strong>Purchase a small computer</strong>. This can be a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, with 8 GB RAM. Lower-cost alternatives are available such as Orange Pi, as well as more powerfull options such as mini computers. In general, if you plan on having lots of computations such as AI and video recording, aim for a mini computer. You can also use an old computer as a server, so long as it can run Linux (non-Linux works, but that is beyond the scope of this guide). If you are intending to use a Raspberry Pi or similar, also purchase a fan for cooling.</p> <p>My setup utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8 GB RAM, with a cooling fan attached. I use a fast phone charger to power the Pi.</p> <p><strong>Warning</strong>: If you use a Pi or similar, always power it with an appropriate power supply. For the Pi 4, a 5V 3A (or higher than 3A) power supply is required.</p> <p>**If you are NOT using a Raspberry Pi or similar, you have to tweak certain aspects of this guide! **</p> <p><strong>Purchase some memory</strong>. This can be a simple microSD card that is 128 GB and above. If you plan on hosting a lot of files, particularly videos, purchase a 16 or 32 GB microSD card along with an external hard drive of your choice.</p> <p>My setup utilizes a 32 GB microSD card (a 16 would have been fine) with a 1 TB external hard disk.</p> <p><strong>Purchase a domain</strong>. Go to <a href="https://porkbun.com/">porkbun</a>, make an account, find a domain, and purchase it. Ensure that the renewal price is not too high, and avoid top-level domains (tld) that do not offer WHOIS privacy. Top-level domains are the “.com”, “.net”, “.us”, etc. that you would see websites end with. WHOIS allows anyone to identify a domain owner, and WHOIS privacy prevents that. This is important since you have to use your phone number and or address to purchase a domain; with WHOIS privacy, you keep this information safe. Avoid a tld such as “.us”, which does not allow WHOIS privacy.</p> <p>For my setup, I purchased “turibiusrozario.com” for USD 11. I could have purchased “turibiusrozario.us” for USD 6, but that would publicize my phone number and personal address, hence I did not purchase the “.us”.</p> <h2 id="step-2-prepare-the-microsd-card-for-the-pi">Step 2: Prepare the microSD card for the Pi</h2> <p>Download and install the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/"> Raspberry Pi Imager </a>. Plug your microSD card in, and run the Imager. Select the Pi device you are using, select “OS Lite 64-bit” as the operating system (this option might be hidden away in a submenu), and select the <strong>correct</strong> microSD card.</p> <p>Click “Next”. Edit some configurations, primarily the names and connectivity. Set a name for the Pi (“local name”), a name for the user (“hostname”), and a password. Enter the Wifi credentials, i.e., the wifi name and password. Ensure that SSH is enabled. Go ahead and continue with installing the operating system on to the microSD card.</p> <p>Once done, plug the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and connect it to a correct power supply.</p> <p>If you are using a mini computer or an old computer, install a Linux operating system on it. If you want to stick to this guide as closely as possible, install Debian.</p> <h2 id="step-3-prepare-the-pi-for-nextcloud">Step 3: Prepare the Pi for Nextcloud</h2> <p>If you are using an external hard drive as the storage media, please format it as ext4 file format. Connect it to the Pi.</p> <p>While the Pi is powered on, SSH into the Pi. To do this, you can open your terminal on a computer and simply type “ssh your_hostname@locale_name.local” to enter. If you are using an old or mini computer, you can follow all the bottom commands without having to SSH.</p> <p><strong>Warning</strong>: In general, you should not just ‘unplug’ the Pi to power it off. It is always recommended that you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo shutdown</code> while connected via SSH to shut the Pi down. If you are using a Pi, you will have to fix locale issues (assuming you are in the US). Once you have SSH’ed into the Pi, enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8</code> If you are using an external hard drive as your storage, do the following:</p> <ol> <li><code> sudo blkid </code>: This showcases all the storages. Your drive will be listed as something like <code>/dev/sdaX</code>. Remember the PARTUUID.</li> <li><code> sudo mkdir /media/NAME </code>: Replace "NAME" with any name you would want to use for the drive. I named mine "Alexandria", though most people simply do "Nextcloud". </li> <li></li> <li><code> sudo nano /etc/fstab </code>: Once in the text editor, add a new line with the following entry: <code> PARTUUID=abcdefgh-00 /media/NAME ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=10s 0 2 </code>. Of course, replace the PARTUID and NAME with the correct ones. Save and exit by pressing CTRL + X, then pressing ENTER.</li> <li><code> sudo usermod -aG hostname hostname </code>: Replace "hostname" with the correct hostname. </li> <li> <code> sudo chown -R hostname /media/NAME </code>: Replace "hostname" and "NAME" with the correct ones. </li> <li> <code> sudo restart </code>: This will close SSH and restart the Pi. You are done with configurating the external hard drive. Make sure to SSH back in. </li> </ol> <p>Update and restart the Pi by running<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade &amp;&amp; sudo restart</code>. Once it restarts, SSH back into the Pi. You can now practically copy and paste the following chunk of code:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>ca-certificates curl

If you want to see what all the code does, the full guide to installing docker can be found <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="step-4-installing-nextcloud">Step 4: Installing Nextcloud</h2> <p>All of the following in this section is done on the Pi. SSH into the Pi to run the commands. If you use a mini computer or an old computer, run the commands on the computer directly. I enabled IPv6 protocol on my Pi for future support (more details about this can be found <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/blob/main/docker-ipv6-support.md">here</a>). To do this, make a new file:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>nano /etc/docker/daemon.json <span class="c"># This file did not exist for me; made new</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And add the lines</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">{</span>
<span class="s2">"default-network-opts"</span>: <span class="o">{</span><span class="s2">"bridge"</span>:<span class="o">{</span><span class="s2">"com.docker.network.enable_ipv6"</span>:<span class="s2">"true"</span><span class="o">}}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And save and exit by pressing CTRL+X and Enter. Then, run:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>systemctl restart docker
<span class="nb">sudo </span>docker network inspect nextcloud-aio | <span class="nb">grep </span>EnableIPv6
<span class="c"># The above command verifies if it's enabled.</span>
<span class="c"># It's likely not, and in fact, AIO should be missing on a first time setup.</span>
<span class="c"># So run:</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>docker network create nextcloud-aio
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Identify the IP address of the Pi. This can be done by entering <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hostname -I</code>. The IP address is typically in the format of “10.0.0.XX” (IPv4). Remember this address since it will be needed later.</p> <p>The following code is taken directly from the Nextcloud AIO. You can see all their guides and documentation <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one">here</a>. I used the following code, where “NAME” refers to my harddrive; change it accordingly. You can remove the entire line if you are not using an external hard drive.</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>docker run <span class="se">\</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="step-5-internet-configurations-and-finishing-up">Step 5: Internet Configurations and Finishing Up</h2> <p>Head to your router’s configuration page, which can typically be accessed by going to “10.0.0.1” on your browser. There, make the IP address for the Pi (found earlier) to be a “Reserved IP” instead of DHCP. This prevents the local address from changing.</p> <p>To enable access to the Pi from anywhere in the world (with internet connectivity), ports have to be opened. On the router’s configuration page, look for “Port Forwarding” option. Forward the following ports for the Pi:</p> <ul> <li>80 TCP</li> <li>443 TCP and UDP</li> <li>3478 TCP and UDP</li> <li>8443 TCP</li> </ul> <p>That is all the configurations needed on the router.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: There are several IP addresses. There are IPv4 addresses that are in the format of X.X.X.X, and IPv6 addresses that are in the format of X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X. Some of these addresses can be local: these are visible only while connected to your router, and is the one that you just found in the above step. There are public IP addresses that can be seen from anywhere in the world: this will be used in the next step.</p> <p>Next, the domain has to be configured to forward to your Nextcloud. On Porkbun, I had to click on “DNS” to configure. Make a Type “A - Address record” with an answer/value consisting of the public IP address. This can be found by searching “What’s my IP?” online. The hostname can be left blank if you want “your_domain.tld” to point to Nextcloud. I used “alexandria.turibiusrozario.com” as the domain, and a TTL value of 3600. This record uses the IPv4 public address. You can additionally add the IPv6 address by creating a Type “AAAA” address record; this will have the same domain name and TTL, but the answer/value will be the IPv6 address (again, you can find this by simply searching “what is my IPv6 address?”).</p> <p>Now, go to “https://10.0.0.X:8080/setup”; replace X with the correct number that points to the Pi. From here, simply follow all the instructions on screen.</p> <p>Once you reach the page where you can choose your containers, keep in mind that the more containers you enable, the more processing power you will need on your device. I kept all the defaults enabled only. Once you click ‘Start’, it might take as much as 10 minutes before everything is ready. Then, you can finally go to “https://your_domain.tld” and enjoy NextCloud!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="software"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft 365 and Google Suite Replacement]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Not Crash Cam</title><link href="https://turibiusrozario.com/blog/2025/not_crash_cam/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Not Crash Cam"/><published>2025-07-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-07-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://turibiusrozario.com/blog/2025/not_crash_cam</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://turibiusrozario.com/blog/2025/not_crash_cam/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="flights-2024-2025">Flights 2024-2025</h2> <video controls="" preload="none" width="100%" poster="https://alexandria.turibiusrozario.com/s/TiCPiE3jJRWoTXQ/preview"> &lt;source src=https://alexandria.turibiusrozario.com/s/TiCPiE3jJRWoTXQ/download" type="video/mp4"&gt; </video>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="aviation"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most times, I don't crash.

Worse, there are applications running in the background that constantly degrade battery life — in particular, almost all of Google services. Worst, the Android that you paid for will not be supported nor last as much as you may want it to.</p> <p>In search for making my cellphone battery last longer hours, and the phone itself to last more years, I began the journey of ‘De-Googling’ my phone. This does not mean removing all Google components. To me, it means utilizing as little closed-source and power-hungry applications as possible, which apps made by big tech tend to be. My process was as follows:</p> <ol> <li> Switching to an open-source OS that does not contain bloatware and major Google backends by default.</li> <li> Utilizing open-source or minimal applications.</li> <li> Regaining ability to use Google applications.</li> </ol> <p><a href="https://divestos.org/misc/e.txt">Here</a> is a comparison of some of the major open-source OS that does not have tracking, and is Google free. If you use a Pixel device, it is best to use <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>. Otherwise, <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices">\/e\/</a> is an option that is ready to use upon installations. I personally use <a href="https://lineage.microg.org/">LineageOS for MicroG</a> since it allows me to utilize some required Google Apps.</p> <p>The very first installation is expected to be the hardest. The process should be the same regardless of what Android you use:</p> <ol> <li> Backup all files: the easiest method is to directly connect your phone to your computer, and copy all files that you have. I additionally recommend going to each app and exporting any configurations that you may have (e.g. contacts, text messages, authenticator codes, etc.). I also recommend having a list of a list of apps you realistically use so that you can re-download them later. </li> <li> Unlocking the bootloader: There are several existing online tutorials for unlocking the bootloader. <a href="https://youtu.be/ksbRMo00uTA"> Here </a> is an example; despite being over 6 years old, the methodology is applicable today. You can use the <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools"> developer's page </a> to download platform tools which will be needed as you follow along any bootloader unlock video. </li> <li> Once unlocked, you can follow <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">your specific device's instructions on how to install LineageOS </a>. However, if you want LineageOS <em>for MicroG</em>, which allows better 'De-Googling' while still being able to use Google applications, you should use the image file (.iso file) from <a href="https://download.lineage.microg.org/"> MicroG's website </a> instead of Lineage's .iso file. You will not have to install any additional files using this method. </li> <li> After completing the reboot, check out F-Droid and all the interesting things LineageOS for MicroG comes with! You will find many better and ad-free alternatives to certain applications you used to use. Or you can use your backup to regain all your past files and re-download your past apps through Aurora Store (which can be downloaded through F-Droid). </li> </ol> <p>It is possible to go even further and root your phone with <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html">Magisk</a> which allows even greater customization such as significantly <a href="https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/">improved camera quality</a>, <a href="https://github.com/di72nn/callrecorder-axet">access to call recording</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/MatteCarra/AccA">controlling how much your phone charges</a> (e.g., to increase longevity of your battery).</p> <p>In terms of alternative applications, here are a couple that I enjoy:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.beemdevelopment.aegis/">Aegies Authenticator</a> : An open source two-factor authentication application. </li> <li> <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.apps.adrcotfas.goodtime/">Goodtime - Pomodoro Timer</a> : The F-Droid version has premium services. </li> <li> <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.cozic.joplin/">Joplin</a> : Open source note-taking application that you can sync between computers and upload to the cloud. </li> <li> <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/">KDE Connect</a> : Links your phone to any other computer or phone to perform things such as: file sharing, controlling the other device, sending messages through the other device, audio play/pause depending on phone calls, and more. </li> <li> <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/">KISS Launcher</a> : Search based launcher to maximize start-ups and increase the rate by which you use your phone </li> <li> <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.organicmaps/">Organic Maps</a> : Maps that is better than Google Maps for jogging and biking. </li> <li> <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus/">OsmAnd</a> : Google Maps alternative, especially for driving. </li> <li> <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.protonvpn.android/">ProtonVPN</a> : Free and one of the top rated VPNs. </li> <li> More applications that you can find in <a href="https://github.com/Psyhackological/AAA">AAA</a>'s website </li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="software"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guide to De-bloating Android]]></summary></entry></feed>
