I am Turibius Rozario, a first-year Mechanical Engineering PhD student at Boston
University. I build drones as a hobby, enjoy exploring new fields
(metaphorically and literally), and am interested in research topics surrounding
renewable energy, climate change mitigation, and sustainability. 

These interests contribute to the overarching themes of using interdisciplinary
sciences to make a tangible, equitable impact: inspiring and enabling the next
generation in STEM, asking and addressing the big questions about policy and
morality, and reducing poverty and fundamental inequality. I believe
collaborative work is essential to solving global challenges like war and
climate change. (_For the math enthusiasts out there: I want to identify and
attain the parameters such that global human happiness and values, and
biodiversity are maximized while ensuring system stability of a non-trivial
solution._)

This website showcases my projects and skills for recruiters and
recommenders, provide tutorials and guides for hobbyists interested in the work
I do, act as a collection of resources and findings for the
curious, and just a space for me to let out some of my thoughts to the world.

**This website is still under renovation, and can be expected to be under
renovation until 2026-01-08**
