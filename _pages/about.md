I am Turibius Rozario, a first-year Mechanical Engineering PhD student at Boston
University. I build drones as a hobby, enjoy exploring new fields
(metaphorically and literally), and am interested in research topics surrounding
renewable energy, climate change mitigation, and sustainability.

I’m driven by a practical, interdisciplinary approach to energy and
sustainability — research and projects that improve people's lives, shape better
policy, and broaden access to opportunity. I care about equity and
collaboration: diverse perspectives make stronger solutions, especially when
tackling systemic challenges like climate change and out-group homogeneity-based
conflict.

This website showcases my projects and skills for recruiters and
recommenders, provide tutorials and guides for hobbyists interested in the work
I do, act as a collection of resources and findings for the
curious, and just a space for me to let out some of my thoughts to the world.
